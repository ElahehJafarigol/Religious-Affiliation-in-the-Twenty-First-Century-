**Abstract**

This paper is a quantitative analysis of the data collected globally by the World Value Survey. The data is used to study the trajectories of change in individualsâ€™ religious 
beliefs, values, and behaviors in societies. Utilizing random forest, we aim to identify the key factors of religiosity and classify respondents of the survey as religious and 
non-religious using country-level data. We use resampling techniques to balance the data and improve imbalanced learning performance metrics. The results of the variable
importance analysis suggest that Age and Income are the most important variables in the majority of countries. The results are discussed with fundamental sociological theories 
regarding religion and human behavior. This study is an application of machine learning in identifying the underlying patterns in the data of 30 countries participating in the 
World Value Survey. The results from variable importance analysis and classification of imbalanced data provide valuable insights beneficial to theoreticians and researchers of social sciences.
